class Factory:
    """Factory objects are immutable and represent a sound that can be played simultaneously multiple times. They are called factories because they create reader objects internally that are used for playback.
    file(filename)
    Creates a factory object of a sound file.
    sine(frequency, rate=48000)
    Creates a sine factory which plays a sine wave.
    buffer()
    Buffers a factory into RAM.
                            This saves CPU usage needed for decoding and file access if the underlying factory reads from a file on the harddisk, but it consumes a lot of memory.
    <Note> Only known-length factories can be buffered.
    delay(time)
    Delays by playing adding silence in front of the other factory’s data.
    fadein(start, length)
    Fades a factory in by raising the volume linearly in the given time interval.
    <Note> Before the fade starts it plays silence.
    fadeout(start, length)
    Fades a factory in by lowering the volume linearly in the given time interval.
    <Note> After the fade this factory plays silence, so that the length of the factory is not altered.
    filter(b, a = (1))
    Filters a factory with the supplied IIR filter coefficients.
                            Without the second parameter you’ll get a FIR filter.
                            If the first value of the a sequence is 0 it will be set to 1 automatically.
                            If the first value of the a sequence is neither 0 nor 1, all filter coefficients will be scaled by this value so that it is 1 in the end, you don’t have to scale yourself.
    highpass(frequency, Q=0.5)
    Creates a second order highpass filter based on the transfer function H(s) = s^2 / (s^2 + s/Q + 1)
    join(factory)
    Plays two factories in sequence.
    <Note> The two factories have to have the same specifications (channels and samplerate).
    limit(start, end)
    Limits a factory within a specific start and end time.
    loop(count)
    Loops a factory.
    <Note> This is a filter function, you might consider using aud.Handle.loop_count instead.
    lowpass(frequency, Q=0.5)
    Creates a second order lowpass filter based on the transfer function H(s) = 1 / (s^2 + s/Q + 1)
    mix(factory)
    Mixes two factories.
    <Note> The two factories have to have the same specifications (channels and samplerate).
    pingpong()
    Plays a factory forward and then backward.
                            This is like joining a factory with its reverse.
    pitch(factor)
    Changes the pitch of a factory with a specific factor.
    <Note> This is done by changing the sample rate of the underlying factory, which has to be an integer, so the factor value rounded and the factor may not be 100 % accurate.
    <Note> This is a filter function, you might consider using aud.Handle.pitch instead.
    reverse()
    Plays a factory reversed.
    <Note> The factory has to have a finite length and has to be seekable. It’s recommended to use this only with factories    with fast and accurate seeking, which is not true for encoded audio files, such ones should be buffered using buffer() before being played reversed.
    square(threshold = 0)
    Makes a square wave out of an audio wave by setting all samples with a amplitude >= threshold to 1, all <= -threshold to -1 and all between to 0.
    volume(volume)
    Changes the volume of a factory.
    <Note> Should be in the range [0, 1] to avoid clipping.
    <Note> This is a filter function, you might consider using aud.Handle.volume instead.
