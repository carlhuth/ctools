        """Image source from an external video stream captured with a DeckLink video card from
                                Black Magic Design.
                                Before this source can be used, a DeckLink hardware device must be installed, it can be a PCIe card
                                or a USB device, and the ‘Desktop Video’ software package (version 10.4 or above must be installed)
                                on the host as described in the DeckLink documentation.
                                If in addition you have a recent nVideo Quadro card, you can benefit from the ‘GPUDirect’ technology
                                to push the captured video frame very efficiently to the GPU. For this you need to install the
                                ‘DeckLink SDK’ version 10.4 or above and copy the ‘dvp.dll’ runtime library to Blender’s
                                installation directory or to any other place where Blender can load a DLL from.
        The format argument must be written as <displayMode>/<pixelFormat>[/3D][:<cacheSize>] where <displayMode>
                                describes the frame size and rate and <pixelFormat> the encoding of the pixels.
                                The optional /3D suffix is to be used if the video stream is stereo with a left and right eye feed.
                                The optional :<cacheSize> suffix determines the number of the video frames kept in cache, by default 8.
                                Some DeckLink cards won’t work below a certain cache size.
                                The default value 8 should be sufficient for all cards.
                                You may try to reduce the cache size to reduce the memory footprint. For example the The 4K Extreme is known
                                to work with 3 frames only, the Extreme 2 needs 4 frames and the Intensity Shuttle needs 6 frames, etc.
                                Reducing the cache size may be useful when Decklink is used in conjunction with GPUDirect:
                                all frames must be locked in memory in that case and that puts a lot of pressure on memory.
                                If you reduce the cache size too much,
                                you’ll get no error but no video feed either.
        The valid <displayMode> values are copied from the BMDDisplayMode enum in the DeckLink API
                                without the ‘bmdMode’ prefix. In case a mode that is not in this list is added in a later version
                                of the SDK, it is also possible to specify the 4 letters of the internal code for that mode.
                                You will find the internal code in the DeckLinkAPIModes.h file that is part of the SDK.
                                Here is for reference the full list of supported display modes with their equivalent internal code:
        Most of names are self explanatory. If necessary refer to the DeckLink API documentation for more information.
        Similarly, <pixelFormat> is copied from the BMDPixelFormat enum.
        Here is for reference the full list of supported pixel format and their equivalent internal code:
        Refer to the DeckLink SDK documentation for a full description of these pixel format.
                                It is important to understand them as the decoding of the pixels is NOT done in VideoTexture
                                for performance reason. Instead a specific shader must be used to decode the pixel in the GPU.
                                Only the ‘8BitARGB’, ‘8BitBGRA’ and ‘10BitRGBXLE’ pixel formats are mapped directly to OpenGL RGB float textures.
                                The ‘8BitYUV’ and ‘10BitYUV’ pixel formats are mapped to openGL RGB float texture but require a shader to decode.
                                The other pixel formats are sent as a GL_RED_INTEGER texture (i.e. a texture with only the
                                red channel coded as an unsigned 32 bit integer) and are not recommended for use.
        Example: HD1080p24/10BitYUV/3D:4 is equivalent to 24ps/v210/3D:4
                                and represents a full HD stereo feed at 24 frame per second and 4 frames cache size.
        Although video format auto detection is possible with certain DeckLink devices, the corresponding
                                API is NOT implemented in the BGE. Therefore it is important to specify the format string that
                                matches exactly the video feed. If the format is wrong, no frame will be captured.
                                It should be noted that the pixel format that you need to specify is not necessarily the actual
                                format in the video feed. For example, the 4K Extreme card delivers 8bit RGBs pixels in the
                                ‘10BitRGBXLE’ format. Use the ‘Media Express’ application included in ‘Desktop Video’ to discover
                                which pixel format works for a particular video stream.

                                for immediate or scheduled playback. The video feed is outputted on HDMI or SDI interfaces.
                                This class supports the immediate playback mode: it has a source attribute that is assigned
                                one of the source object in the bge.texture module. Refreshing the DeckLink object causes
                                the image source to be computed and sent to the DeckLink device for immediate transmission
                                on the output interfaces.  Keying is supported: it allows to composite the frame with an
                                input video feed that transits through the DeckLink card.
        The default value of the format argument is reserved for auto detection but it is currently
                                not supported (it will generate a runtime error) and thus the video format must be explicitly
                                specified. If keying is the goal (see keying attributes), the format must match exactly the
                                input video feed, otherwise it can be any format supported by the device (there will be a
                                runtime error if not).
                                The format of the string is <displayMode>[/3D].
        Refer to bge.texture.VideoDeckLink to get the list of acceptable <displayMode>.
                                The optional /3D suffix is used to create a stereo 3D feed.
                                In that case the ‘right’ attribute must also be set to specify the image source for the right eye.
        Note: The pixel format is not specified here because it is always BGRA. The alpha channel is
                                used in keying to mix the source with the input video feed, otherwise it is not used.
                                If a conversion is needed to match the native video format, it is done inside the DeckLink driver
                                or device.

                                                        they can either be used for capture or playback but not both at the same time.

    The value corresponds to an internal material number that uses the texture identified

                            identify the texture directly. This method works for basic tex face and for material,
                            provided the material has a texture channel using that particular texture in first

                            the texture by material. In that case the material must have a texture channel in first

    If the object has no material that matches name, it generates a runtime error.
